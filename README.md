# Articles_Recommendation_System_Using_Non_Negative_Matrix_Factorization
To build a recommendation system for Medium articles, we plan to use Non-Negative Matrix Factorization technique to group together articles that share similar topics.
NMF: ML techniques used for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction in the field of linear algebra and data analysis. It is commonly used in data preprocessing, image processing, text mining and other application where underlying data can be represented as non-negative values.

Before using NMF to build the *Recommender System, we have to perform some Natural Language Processing* steps such as vectorizing data using TF-IDF. Also, we have perform *Exploratory Data Analysis* before diving into applying machine learning.
Finally, we sort the results based on number of claps (likes), because we want to recommend to readers good articles in the same topic that they are currently reading/interested in.
NLP particularly used for text analysis and topic modeling.
TF-IDF(Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): Numeric representation of the word within a collection of documnet in the field of information retrieval and text mining.
